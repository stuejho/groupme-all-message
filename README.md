# Group Mention for GroupMe

Group Mention for GroupMe is an application designed to allow GroupMe users to send messages mentioning/tagging all users in a group. This functionality is not provided natively in GroupMe, so this application uses the Groupme API to fulfill this service. The code invoking the GroupMe API is invoked client-side after users authenticate via Groupme.

## Usage

1. Navigate to [Group Mention for GroupMe](https://groupmention.uc.r.appspot.com/).
2. Click "Sign In" and enter your GroupMe credentials. You will be redirected to GroupMe for authentication.
3. After being redirected back to Group Mention for GroupMe, select a group*, compose your message, and send it!

*NOTE: You **MUST** be an admin/owner of a group to send a group mention.
